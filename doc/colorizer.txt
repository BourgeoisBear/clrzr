*colorizer.txt*                                    Color code highlighter.  v1.5
*Colorizer* *'colorizer'*
===============================================================================

This plugin defines three commands:

  *:ColorHighlight*      - start/update highlighting
  *:ColorClear*          - clear all highlights
  *:ColorToggle*         - toggle highlights
  *:ColorAlphaPosToggle* - toggle alpha position for hex colors

By default, <leader>tc is mapped to ColorToggle. If you want to use another
key map, do like this:
  nmap ,tc <Plug>Colorizer

                                                          *'g:colorizer_nomap'*
If you want completely not to map it, set the following in your vimrc:
 let g:colorizer_nomap = 1

                                                     *'g:colorizer_fgcontrast'*
To use solid color highlight, set this in your vimrc (later change won't
probably take effect unless you use ':ColorHighlight!' to force update):
 let g:colorizer_fgcontrast = -1

Set it to 0 or 1 to use a softened foregroud color.

                                                        *'g:colorizer_startup'*
If you don't want to enable colorizer at startup, set the following:
 let g:colorizer_startup = 0

                                                       *'g:colorizer_maxlines'*
You can disable it on long buffers, for example if more than 1000 lines:
  let g:colorizer_maxlines = 1000
-1 means an unlimited number of lines

                                                *'g:colorizer_hex_alpha_first'*
There are color strings in the format #RRGGBBAA and #AARRGGBB. The former is
more common so it's the default. If you want the latter, set the following:
 let g:colorizer_hex_alpha_first = 1

You can toggle the recognized alpha position with:
  *:ColorAlphaPosToggle*

Note: if you modify a color string in normal mode, if the cursor is still on
that line, it'll take 'updatetime' seconds to update. You can use
*:ColorHighlight* (or your key mapping) again to force update.
